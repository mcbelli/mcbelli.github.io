## Featured Project

### Insurance Marketing Analytics Decision Engine

This project demonstrates how to integrate data science into marketing and business decisions for a B2C insurance company. Rather than building isolated models, it shows how funnel analytics, segmentation, and predictive insights combine to drive profitable growth.

### The Business Problem

In insurance, growth without risk discipline destroys value. Marketing teams optimize for lead volume and cost-per-lead, but cheap leads often become unprofitable policies. This project answers:

1. Which marketing channels drive *profitable* growth—not just volume?
2. How do we balance lead acquisition cost against underwriting quality?
3. Where should we reallocate spend to maximize lifetime value?

### Key Analyses

#### 1. Credit Score Impact on Conversion and Loss Ratio

Credit-based insurance scores are a major underwriting tool. This analysis validates that better credit correlates with higher conversion rates AND lower claims—not just ability to pay.

**Finding:** Excellent credit customers convert at 3x the rate of Poor credit, with loss ratios 20 percentage points lower.

---

#### 2. Optimal Age Bands by Product

Age is the primary rating variable in life and health insurance. The optimal customer age differs by product line, reflecting different risk profiles and purchasing behaviors.

**Finding:** Life insurance LTV peaks at ages 36-45; Health and P&C show different patterns requiring tailored targeting strategies.

---

#### 3. Cross-Sell and Multi-Product Opportunity

Bundled customers have 90%+ retention vs ~80% for single-product. This analysis quantifies the cross-sell opportunity.

![Cross-Sell Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcbelli/insurance-marketing-analytics-decision-engine/notebooks/model_outputs/analysis_3_cross_sell.png)

**Finding:** Multi-product leads convert 2x better and deliver 2x higher lifetime value.

---

#### 4. Geographic Performance Variation

Insurance is state-regulated—each state has different rate approval processes, coverage mandates, and competitive dynamics.

![Geographic Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcbelli/insurance-marketing-analytics-decision-engine/notebooks/model_outputs/analysis_4_geographic.png)

**Finding:** Loss ratios vary significantly by state, indicating need for geographic risk pricing and targeted underwriting.

---

#### 5. Adverse Selection by Marketing Channel

Cheaper acquisition channels attract higher-risk customers. This analysis quantifies the adverse selection effect.

![Early Claims Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcbelli/insurance-marketing-analytics-decision-engine/notebooks/model_outputs/analysis_5_early_claims.png)

**Finding:** Email channel (lowest CPL) has 17% higher early claim rates than paid search—evidence of adverse selection.

---

#### 6. Marketing ROI by Channel

What matters for marketing budget allocation is profit per marketing dollar spent, not average profit per policy. A channel with lower profit per policy can still be the better investment if acquisition costs are low enough so that the additional leads and policies more than offset the lower average policy profitability.

![Policy Profitability Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcbelli/insurance-marketing-analytics-decision-engine/notebooks/model_outputs/analysis_6_policy_profitability.png)

**Finding:** When comparing profit generated per dollar of marketing spend, it is clear that shifting dollars toward the highest-ROI channel maximizes total profit from a fixed marketing budget. Shift budget towards email.

---

#### 7. State-Level Claims and Loss Ratios

Identifying geographic risk concentration to inform pricing and underwriting decisions.

![State Claims Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcbelli/insurance-marketing-analytics-decision-engine/notebooks/model_outputs/analysis_7_state_claims.png)

**Finding:** Identified 5 high-risk states requiring rate increases or stricter underwriting criteria.

---

#### 8. Bind Rate vs. Claims Rate Trade-off

Do higher-converting channels produce riskier policies? This tests the quality-quantity trade-off.

![Bind vs Claims Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcbelli/insurance-marketing-analytics-decision-engine/notebooks/model_outputs/analysis_8_bind_vs_claims.png)

**Finding:** Positive correlation (r=0.43) confirms that optimizing purely for conversion volume increases claims risk.

---

### Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

1. **Shift budget toward email** to optimize for profit per marketing dollar spent
2. **Implement credit-score-based lead prioritization** in the sales process
3. **Investigate high-loss-ratio states** for rate adequacy
4. **Invest in cross-sell/bundling** to improve retention and LTV

---

### Technical Implementation

**Data Generation:** Python script creating synthetic but realistic insurance marketing data with:
- 3 years of lead data across 3 products (Health, Life, Property/Casualty)
- 3 marketing channels with quality/cost trade-offs built in
- Full sales funnel (Lead → Qualified → Quote → Binder → Sold)
- Demographics, claims simulation, and policy economics

**Analysis:** 8 EDA modules demonstrating insurance domain expertise:
- Credit-based underwriting validation
- Actuarial age segmentation
- Bundling/retention economics
- State regulatory impact
- Adverse selection measurement
- Channel profitability analysis
